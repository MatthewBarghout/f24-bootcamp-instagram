# Description

This is a simple Instagram-like UI demo built using SwiftUI. 

- What does it do?  
  This app presents a basic post layout with:
  - An author section displaying the user's profile image and username.
  - An image displayed as the post's content.
  - Engagement options such as heart, comment, share, and bookmark icons.
  - The number of likes, a description, and the time since the post was made.

- What tools/concepts did you use to make it?**  
  The app is built using SwiftUI with components like `VStack`, `HStack`, `Image`, `Text`, and `.frame` modifiers. It demonstrates basic layout handling, user profile management, and post engagement interactions.

- What features do you want to implement in the future?**  
  - Implementing a real image picker for profile and post images.
  - Adding interactivity for the icons (like, comment, share, etc.).
  - Enhancing layout for responsive design across multiple screen sizes.
